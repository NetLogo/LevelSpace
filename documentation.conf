# LS Extension for NetLogo

LevelSpace is an extension for NetLogo that allows you to run several models concurrently and have them "talk" with each other. LevelSpace models are hierarchical, in that models always belong hierarchically to another model. In this documentation, we will refer to models that have loaded LevelSpace and have opened models as 'parents', and to the models they have opened as 'children' or 'child models'.

Create the specified number of instances of the given .nlogo model.  The path can be absolute, or relative to the main model. Compared with `ls:create-interactive-models`, this primitive creates lightweight models that are hidden by default. You should use this primitive if you plan on having many instances of the given model. The models may be shown using `ls:show`; when visible, they will have a view and command center, but no other widgets, e.g. plots or monitors.

If given a command, LevelSpace will call the command after loading each instance of the model with the `model-id` as the argument. This allows you to easily store model ids in a variable or list when loading models, or do other initialization. For example, to store a model id in a variable, you can do:

```NetLogo
let model-id 0
(ls:create-models "My-Model.nlogo" [ [id] -> set model-id id ])
```

Creates a variable containing the given data that can be accessed by the child models.

```NetLogo
ls:let num-turtles count turtles
ask turtles [
  ls:ask brain-model [
    create-turtles num-turtles
  ]
]
```

`ls:let` works quite similar to `let` in that the variable is only locally accessible:

```NetLogo
ask turtles [
  ls:let my-color color
]
;; my-color is innaccessible here
```

`ls:let` is very similar to `let`, except in a few cases.

- `ls:let` will overwrite previous values in the variable

If you do

```NetLogo
ls:let my-var 5
ls:let my-var 6
```

`my-var` will be set equal to `6`. There is no `ls:set`.

- `ls:let` supports variable shadowing

If you do

```NetLogo
ls:let my-var 5
ask turtles [
  ls:let my-var 6
  ls:ask child-model [ show my-var ]
]
ls:ask child-model [ show my-var ]
```

`child-model` will show `6` and then `5`. This is known as [variable shadowing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_shadowing).

- The parent model cannot directly read the value of an ls variable

For example, this does *not* work.

```NetLogo
ls:let my-var 5
show my-var
```

This is intentional. ls variables are meant to be used for sharing data with child models. The parent model already has access to the data.

Furthermore, changing the value of an ls let variable in a child model will not affect it in any other model. For example:

```NetLogo
ls:let my-var 0
ls:ask ls:models [
  set my-var my-var + 1
  show my-var
]
```

All models will print `1`.

- `ls:let` does not respect the scope of `if`, `when`, and `repeat`

This behavior should be considered a bug and not relied upon. It is an unfortunate consequence of the way the NetLogo engine works. Hopefully, we'll be able to correct this in a future version of NetLogo.

For example, this is allowable:

```NetLogo
if true [
  ls:let my-var 5
]
ls:ask child-model [ create-turtles my-var ]
```

The scope of `ask` is respected, however.
