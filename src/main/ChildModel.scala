  /**
    * Opens the model specified by the given path with the bytecode generator disabled.
    *
    * See https://github.com/NetLogo/LevelSpace/issues/123 for context. Basically, the bytecode generator results in
    * excessive numbers of classes being created for child model, resulting often in a CompressedClassSpace OOM.
    * We solve this by disabling the bytecode generator. This also significantly speeds up child model creation,
    * resulting in much better runtimes for many models.
    *
    * See https://github.com/NetLogo/LevelSpace/pull/140#issuecomment-533915713 for why this is so complicated.
    * Basically, we want to allow models to be opened in parallel (primarily for BehaviorSpace, but also for child
    * models that use LevelSpace), so don't want one model to turn the generator back on before another has checked
    * to see if it should use the generator or not. This is solves by tracking how many models are currently being
    * created. However, this is complicated by the fact that each LevelSpace instance exists in its own classloader, so
    * can't easily share a singleton to share this information. Using a system property to track the number of models
    * was the best solution I could think of. Another solution would require, for instance, walking up the tree of
    * classloaders to get to topmost LevelSpace's classloader to retrieve a singleton tracking this count. But that
    * seemed significantly more complicated.
    *
    * Other solutions considered:
    *
    * - Only allow one model to open at a time by synchronizing on a shared object. This significantly increases
    *   congestion and results in a significant performance hit.
    * - Re-enable the generator on `unload` for the topmost LevelSpace. However, this may result in the generator being
    *   disabled at inappropriate times, such as while compiling strings for `run` and `runresult`. This might still
    *   happen with the current solution, but it is significantly less likely. I also don't fully trust `unload` to
    *   always run.
    * @param opener Should be, e.g., workspace.open(String)
    * @param modelPath The path to the model
